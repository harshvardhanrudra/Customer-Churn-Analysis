# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a subscription-based service, such as a streaming platform or telecom company. The goal is to identify key factors leading to customer churn and create a predictive model that helps the company take proactive steps to retain at-risk customers.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Collect and preprocess customer data, including demographics, usage patterns, payment history, and customer service interactions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze customer demographics and behavior to identify trends and patterns in churn.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can help predict churn, such as average monthly usage and customer service call count.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use various classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict customer churn.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Identify the top factors contributing to churn and provide actionable recommendations.
- **Visualization and Reporting**: Visualize key findings and create dashboards and reports for stakeholders.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/customer-churn-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook to start working with the project:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Load the dataset from a source such as Kaggle or generate synthetic data.
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze customer demographics and usage patterns.
- Visualize churn rates across various segments, such as age, location, and service usage, using plots and charts.
- Identify trends and correlations in the data.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Create new features that could improve model performance, such as:
  - **Average Monthly Usage**: Average number of hours or activities per month.
  - **Days Since Last Interaction**: Days since the customer last used the service.
  - **Customer Service Call Count**: Number of times a customer contacted support.
- Assess feature importance and correlations with churn.

### 4. Modeling
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train various classification models, such as:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forests**
- Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the best model.

### 5. Evaluation
- Compare the models based on their performance metrics.
- Select the best-performing model for predicting churn.

### 6. Insights and Recommendations
- Identify the main factors contributing to churn, such as high customer service call counts or low usage.
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn, like targeted marketing campaigns or improved customer service.

### 7. Visualization and Reporting
- Use visualization tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, or **Tableau** to create insightful charts and dashboards.
- Summarize key findings and prepare a report or presentation for stakeholders.
